# About
Hi there. My name is Daniel Wilson, but you can call me Danny. I'm a front-end web developer from Manchester who is studying Web and Mobile Application Development at Manchester Metropolitan University.

I'm currently in the third year at university, writting my dissertation and looking for a job for when I leave.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on any of these sites. I share on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wilsonand1). I put most of my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/wilsonand1). You can see what I'm seeing on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/wilsonand1_). And listen to what I'm listening to on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/1128636631). Or you could just <a href="mailto:danwilson32@gmail.com">email me</a>.
