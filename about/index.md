# About
Hi there. My name is Daniel Wilson. I'm a front-end web developer from Manchester. After graduating from Manchester Metropolitsn University, I'm now working for [BJL](http://bjl.co.uk).

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on any of these sites. I share on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wilsonand1). I put most of my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/wilsonand1). You can see what I'm seeing on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/wilsonand1_). And listen to what I'm listening to on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/1128636631). Or you could just <a href="mailto:hello@danwilson.co">email me</a>. Or if you're paranoid about the NSA, you can find my [public key](https://keybase.io/wilson) on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io).
