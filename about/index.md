# About
Hi there. My name is Danny Wilson and I'm Django develoer from Manchester. I'm currently traveling the world working on hobby projects when I get the time. 

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on any of these sites. I share on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wilsonand1). I put most of my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/wilsonand1). You can see what I'm seeing on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/wilsonand1). And listen to what I'm listening to on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/1128636631). Or you could just <a href="mailto:dannywilson32@gmail.com">email me</a>. Or if you're paranoid about the NSA, you can find my [public key](https://keybase.io/wilson) on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io).
