# Sick of sucking

I'm sick of sucking, at design that is. I've never been very creative. But now that I want to become a web developer, I'm going to have to start being able to design websites, and that requires me to be creative and stop sucking.

I don't know if it's just me but I can't stand anything I've designed myself. I just hate it all. It's get's praised by others but I just can't deal with it. And this needs to stop. I believe that anything can be taught, you're not born with abilities other cannot gain, you just get a head start. So the plan is to learn to design.

The plan is three fold:

## Design more
I read a post the other day about sketching everyday and the benefits that came from this habit (Apologies, I can't find it). So I intend on doing something similar. Sketching out a website in my notebook a day. Or a logo. Or at least something relevant. Hopefully, the more I do it the better I will get. This should also improve my wire framing. I'm notoriously bad for jumping straight into my editor with an idea. Or just drawing a couple of boxes in my notebook. I need to start drawing up a proper wireframe and then take it further. But the design doesn't just stop there. The better of the designs and logos will hopefully get made up and then probably thrown on [Github](http://github.com/wilsonand1) or maybe I'll do something like [Benjamin Hawkyard's](http://benjaminhawkyard.co.uk) awesome [iconicle](http://iconicle.co) site to showcase them. But they probably won't make it off my hard drive. 

## Read more
I do enjoy reading (sometimes) but it's got to be the right kind of book. I'm not the biggest fiction reader. I usually just start thinking about something else I should be doing, and then I can't think about anything else until I've done what I need to do. So I find it hard to read fiction books. Non-fiction however, I can read quite easily. I'm currently making my way through [Practical Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers-ebook/dp/B00I8W50SY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394231551&sr=8-1&keywords=practical+vim) and [Ordering Disorder](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ordering-Disorder-Principles-Design-Voices-ebook/dp/B004E9SUZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394231675&sr=8-1&keywords=ordering+disorder). I plan to read more design books to build a theoretical knowledge on the topic. I'd also love to read more fiction books.

## Stop thinking that I suck
I need to not be so hard on myself. I'm all for constructive criticism. That's the main thing I want back when I ask someone what they think about what I'm working on. But my criticism to myself is not constructive. It's mainly "That's shit. Stop being shit." And that's no good for anyone. So instead of just writing off a design as shit, I'll do what everyone else does and adapt on the design. Rework it. Make it better. As of now, I can't seem to do this because I can't get over how bad I am. But I'm going to make the effort to take my time on design, not rush the little details, and really make it the best it can be.

So that's the plan, now all I need to do is make it a reality. That's the hard part. It's easy to come up with the plan, or the idea. But to execute upon the plan, or the idea, is the hardest part.
